MSS: Messed up Style Sheet
==========================

Write CSS in a functional way with pure javascript.

Intro
-----

MSS.parse takes a mss object as input and output a css string

+ A mss object is a plain javascript object, usually nested

+ A key will be a CSS selector if its value is another mss object, otherwise it will be taken as a property name for CSS

+ MSS will parse the nested object into nested selectors by connnecting selectors into a descendant selector

Let's see an example:

```javascript
mss = {
  FooClass: {
    zIndex: 999,
    $BarId_AnotherClass: {
      MozBoxShadow: '10px 10px 5px #888',
      input: {
        borderRadius: '12px',
        padding: '12px',
        width: '100%'
      }
    }
  }
};

// set second argmument to true to enable prettify
console.log(MSS.parse(mss, true));

```

will yield:

```css
.FooClass #barId input,
.FooClass .AnotherClass input{
  border-radius:12px;
  padding:12px;
  width:100%;
}
.FooClass #barId,
.FooClass .AnotherClass{
  -moz-box-shadow:10px 10px 5px #888;
}
.FooClass{
  z-index:999;
}
```

As shown above, the selectors and prop name are converted for the writing ease in Javascript(using valid variable as much as possible) 

As a coffeescript user, i would write former example in coffeescript:

```coffee
mss =
    FooClass:
        zIndex: 999
        $BarId_AnotherClass:
            MozBoxShadow: '10px 10px 5px #888888'
            Input:
                borderRadius: '12px'
                padding: '12px'
                width: '100%'   
                
console.log MSS.parse(mss, true)
```

Much nicer! For the sake of clearity, following example will be written in coffee, sorry for the inconveince.
Let's explain how mss translate your plain object into a css string in detail:

Rules for parsing a mss selectors
---------------------------------

+ Class selector is written in UpperCase and keep UpperCase
+ html tag selector is written in lowerCase and keep lowerCase
+ id selector is written in $UpperCase and turn into lowerCase

mss
    Slider: 
        margin: ...
css
    .Slider { margin: ...}

mss
    canvas: 
        margin: ...
css
    canvas { margin: ...}

mss
    $Index:
        margin: ...
css
    #index { margin: ...}

+ `$` used to write pesudo-class selector:

mss
    SliderBtn:
        padding: ...
        $hover:
            color: ...
css
    .SliderBtn { padding: ... }
    .SliderBtn:hover { color: ... }
```

+ `_` turn selector into a list of selectors, and you can nest list

mss
    BlueBird_BlueOcean:
        color: \blue
        RedText_$RedWine_Span:
            color: \red
css
    .BlueBird, 
    .BlueOcean {
        color: blue;
    }
    .BlueBird .RedText, 
    .BlueBird #redWine,
    .BlueBird span,
    .BlueOcean .RedText, 
    .BlueOcean #redWine,
    .BlueOcean span { 
        color: red;
    }

Rules for parsing a mss property name
-------------------------------------

+ turn `camelCase` to `camel-case` and `MyCamelCase` to `-my-camel-case`

mss
    FooBar:
        marginLeft: \50%
        MozBoxShadow: '10px 10px 5px #888888'
css
    .FooBar {
        margin-left: 50%;
        -moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
    }

Functions and Mixins
--------------------

Here comes the fun part, since the plain mss object you write is actual a simplified CSS AST, so all mixins can be write in plain javascript.


Functions
---------

Since all property are strings, we can write a function to help us convert between numbers and string, for example:


mss

    px = (x) -> x + 'px' 
    pc = (x) -> x + '%'

    $OhMyGod:
        margin: px 2
        padding: pc 10

css

    #ohMyGod {
        margin: 2px 4px 5px;
        padding 10% 10%;
    }
 
There's lots of functions are built-in in MSS, they are written in camelCase, such as `px` or `linearGrad`, and they are much general, for example the built-in `px` function can take multiple arguments.



Mixins
------

Mixins are special functions, they should take some parameters(or none), then return a function that modify mss object, let's write one:

mss

    Center$ = (mss) ->
        mss.textAlign = 'center'
        mss

    Padding = (pad) -> (mss) ->
        mss.padding = pad
        mss


    input: Center$ Padding('2px')
        margin: 0

css

    input{
        margin: 0;
        padding: '2px';
        text-align: 'center';
    }


Other functions
---------------

You can define other functions to achieve more powerful effect, there're some built-in functions written in UPPER_CASE, they're generally some functions operating on whole mss tree:
